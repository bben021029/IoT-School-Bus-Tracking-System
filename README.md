# 🚌 IoT School Bus Tracking System

An IoT-based school bus monitoring solution using GPS and RFID technology to track real-time location and student attendance, aiming to improve safety and provide visibility into school transportation.

## 🧾 Overview

This system is developed to track the location of a school bus in real time and log students’ boarding and alighting activities using RFID. Parents and administrators can view this data through a web interface. The solution is built with an Uno-ESP32 microcontroller and communicates with ThingSpeak for cloud-based data visualization.

## ✨ Features

- 📍 **Live Bus Location Tracking** using the Neo-6M GPS module  
- 🎫 **RFID-based Student Logging** with PN532 reader  
- 🖥️ **LCD Display** for status messages and scanned student information  
- ☁️ **Data Upload to ThingSpeak** for cloud visualization  
- 🗺️ **Real-time Route Mapping** with Leaflet.js and OpenRouteService  
- 📶 **WiFi Communication Only** – No GSM Module used

## 🧩 Architecture & Components

The system architecture consists of the following:

- 🧠 **Uno-ESP32** as the main controller, connecting to WiFi and managing all sensors  
- 🎫 **PN532 RFID Reader** to detect student IDs during boarding/alighting  
- 📡 **Neo-6M GPS Module** to get latitude and longitude coordinates continuously  
- 📟 **I2C LCD Display** to show current system status and student names/IDs  
- ☁️ **ThingSpeak** as the cloud backend for storing and plotting data  
- 🖥️ **Web Dashboard** built with HTML, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and OpenRouteService for map rendering and route visualization

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

- 🧠 Uno-ESP32  
- 🎫 PN532 RFID Module  
- 📡 Neo-6M GPS Module  
- 📟 I2C LCD Display (e.g., 16x2 or 20x4)  
- 🔌 Breadboard, jumper wires  

## 💻 Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (with necessary board and library installations)  
- Required Arduino libraries:  
  - `Wire.h`  
  - `WiFi.h`  
  - `ThingSpeak.h`  
  - `WiFiUdp.h`  
  - `NTPClient.h`  
  - `HTTPClient.h`  
  - `TinyGPS++.h`  
  - `Adafruit_PN532.h`  
  - `LiquidCrystal_I2C.h`  
- ThingSpeak account with public or private channel  
- 🌐 HTML/JS web interface to visualize data and routes

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. 🔌 **Connect the hardware**:
   - Wire the GPS to the correct UART pins on the Uno-ESP32  
   - Connect the PN532 using I2C  
   - Connect the LCD to I2C pins (SDA/SCL)  

2. 📶 **Configure WiFi and ThingSpeak credentials** in the Arduino sketch  

3. 📥 **Upload the Arduino code** to the Uno-ESP32 using Arduino IDE  

4. 🖥️ **Launch the web dashboard** to visualize the bus location and student log

## 📘 Usage

- Students tap their RFID cards when boarding or alighting  
- The system logs the timestamp, coordinates, and student ID to ThingSpeak  
- The LCD screen displays the student ID and confirmation  
- The web interface displays:
  - 📍 Live bus position  
  - 🔁 Trip direction (home → school or school → home)  
  - 🧾 Recent RFID logs

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 📱 Add support for push notifications or integration with messaging APIs  
- 📍 Implement geofencing alerts for out-of-bound routes  
- 🔐 Add secure login and data encryption for web dashboard  
- 📊 Support for historical route replay and attendance summary reports
